# FPGA Attestation Repository

This repository is maintained by the **azhpc team** and serves as a public-facing resource for FPGA attestation-related tools and scripts. It is intended to provide customers with easy access to essential validation resources and contribute to secure, reliable FPGA deployments.

## Purpose

The repository currently hosts **attestation validation scripts** that are designed to let customers validate/run our attestation service. These scripts are intended to ensure that FPGAs meet the required security and compliance standards.

## Future Contributions

This repository may be expanded over time to include additional resources, tools, or scripts related to FPGA attestation and validation as we continue to refine our offerings.
